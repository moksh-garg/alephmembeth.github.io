# Self: Institution vs Impulse

The paper The Real Self: From Institution to Impulse by Ralph Turner (1961) delves into the varying interpretations of the “real self ”. Turner
identifies and juxtaposes two important perspectives: the “institutionalist” view, where the real
self is seen as aligning with social and cultural norms, and the “impulsivist” view, which regards
the self as real for its authentic and uninhibited display – notwithstanding the institutional
prescriptions. This paper is motivated to illuminate this useful distinction and examine how the
increasing prominence of the impulsive notion of the self imperils traditional social theories
that predominantly adhere to an institutionalist understanding of the self. To that extent, I
find the paper well-motivated and well-intentioned; it draws attention to meta-theoretical
inconsistencies that plague our understanding of the social phenomenon and impels scholars
to reflect on the ontological bases of our theories to remain timely and relevant.
Theory : Turner objectifies the self. This is consistent with Stone’s conception of identity
– which entails conscious objectification of the self in a pursuit to establish oneself as similar
to some and distinct from others in a social system. He further contends that by treating the
self as an object, one can distinguish between a part of them that is real and personal and one
that is not. Consequently, what is regarded as the true self may vary across individuals and is a
matter of where their sense of self is located or anchored.

Individuals with an institutional focus recognize and uphold normative standards to define
and project their true selves. This could mean doing things to comply with the ideals of
being noble, courageous, altruistic, or even self-sacrificing.

On the other hand, individuals centered around impulsive focus are moved by their inter-
nal desires as opposed to some external social pressures. They are predisposed to act
spontaneously in ways that may or may not be socially acceptable.
An interesting analogy here would be to characterize individuals with institutional focus
to emphasize and prioritize their public self and individuals anchored in impulsive self as more
in touch with their private self. Another useful way to think about the institutional-impulse
divide would be to invoke the sub-Kantian externalist and sub-Humean internalist perspectives
to human action. The institutional focus is analogous to acting in ways motivated by external
standards, whereas the impulsive focus accords primacy to internal desires over external
standards.

While the discussion on institutional and impulsive self is certainly fascinating, I do not
find it necessarily very productive because of the reasons below:

• The presumption that institution and impulse are antithetical to each other is question-
able on multiple grounds. Here I can think of many plausible scenarios where both are
coincident: first, a person being impulsive but within permissible institutional bound-
aries; second, impulse reflecting embodiment of institutional norms and beliefs to the
core – for example, as an Indian I tend to touch elder people’s feet to seek their blessings
and many times I have actively desisted myself from doing that after having moved to
America; and third, contexts where being impulsive is encouraged as an institution – for
example, meeting a doctor or psychiatrist or even when surrounded with close friends.

• There is no proper explanation about what really constitutes an impulsive real self. The
way Turner presents it, impulse comprises uninhibited actions that defy or denigrate
institutions. But that may not always be true. On the contrary, I argue that impulsivist
self could lead to the creation of institutionalist self. As a case in point, think of uncon-
ventional social actors such as Donald Trump who have openly deviated from the norms
and by Turner’s definition are supposedly anchored in their impulsivist self. But should
their behavior be construed as the display of their impulsivist real self? I do not think
so. I say this because the seemingly impulsive behavior is also a well-thought-out and
reasoned strategic scheme to deviate, stand out, and manipulate institutions. What this
means is that impulsion does not substitute institutionalization but leads to modification
and even the formation of new institutions.

Therefore, theories anchored in institutional focus are likely to remain relevant even if
the implusivist self becomes more prominent.

According to Turner, a display of impulsive behavior has grown
over the years, undermining the institutional underpinnings of social theories. He is primarily
concerned about the deeply entrenched institutional focus of our social theories that may
render them conceptually inadequate to explain the evolving social reality.
However, I believe Turner is being overly cautious and a large part of his skepticism is
unwarranted. First and foremost, he is speculative in his approach as no supporting empirical
evidence is presented in the paper. Second, he treats institutional and impulse-led behaviors
as substitutes, which can very much be characterized as complements based on our discussion
above. This explains why more than half a century has elapsed since this piece was written
and despite that social theories rooted in institutional logic are still as prevalent as back in the
day. However, I still appreciate the read and consider it an insightful take as it advances our
understanding of two distinct perspectives to conceptualize the self
