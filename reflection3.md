I am confronted with a set of paradoxes that explain my ambivalence and for the most part my critical outlook towards organizations,
particularly if analyzed from the labor standpoint.

• While organizations are widely regarded as administrative repertoires comprised of and
fueled by individuals who come together in pursuit of some common objectives, do they
really act as stewards and custodians of those who partake?

• Do organizations constitute a level-playing platform that brings and knits people to-
gether and, in the process, creates and delivers shared yet equitable value for everyone
involved? Or are they carefully devised instruments of and by the elite to reproduce –
rather imperceptibly – the prevalent social order and power structure?

• Is there something inherently divisive and disenfranchising about the very concept of
organizations? Has their identity been legitimized for the economic or developmental
value they generate without thinking too much about how they transform, for better or
worse, the society at large and its underlying dynamics?

I do not shy away from conceding to the fact that organizations as collectivities have
ushered in an age of tremendous economic growth: what was once extraordinarily complex
for an individual to accomplish has become downright effortless. Yet, they have also become
a breeding ground or rather a persistent and durable source of socio-economic disparities
with far-reaching consequences. To understand why this could be the case, we need to delve
into organizational control, its types, and how it is enforced and exercised over employees.
As I put my mind to it, I can immediately think of four different sources of employee control
based on my personal experiences as a corporate worker. I would like to call them physical,
psychological, legal, and normative . This should not be construed as any definitive conceptual
or theoretical claim overriding any of the existing scholarly work or well-established typology
of the bases of social control. I am just trying to introspect and make sense of my own personal
experiences by proposing a plausible classificatory scheme.

• Physical: Workers could be siloed into different units and departments and even dis-
tributed across different locations, especially at the floor level, to suppress collective
consciousness and forestall events of mass mobilization and retaliation. A slightly more
plausible scenario involves managing and controlling the flow of information through
rigid and often obfuscated organizational hierarchies. The prior literature on organi-
zations and social movements underscores the importance of free spaces for workers
to mobilize themselves, organize in groups, and effect organizational change (Polletta
1999, Kellogg 2009, and Rao & Dutta, 2012).

• Legal: Workers also find themselves circumscribed because of extensive legal contracts
and systems in place. From specifying employment best practices to what constitutes
an admissible workplace behavior, a large part of an employee’s individual existence
is codified and translated into a bunch of soul-deprecating contracts. Most of these
contracts are tilted in the favor of the employer, laying an imbalanced foundation for
the so-called partnership of equals. As a matter of fact, it is not even surprising that
organizations allude to some of these clauses to justify retrenchment and mass layoffs
and foster an impersonal environment that may prompt employees into quiet-quitting
and moon-lighting.

• Psychological: Organizations often deploy a combination of monetary and non-monetary
devices to create and heighten the sense of dependency amongst its workers. In one
of the readings assigned for this week, such tactics have been alluded to as welfare
capitalism. The increased psychological dependency – as organizations act paternalistic
and engineer systems and processes to become more involved and influential in workers’
personal and professional lives – create cognitive frames that may limit employees’ sense
of independence and agency. It could be difficult or rather virtually impossible for them
to even think of a life without far-reaching organizational involvement and support.

• Normative: By normative, I emphasise the constraining impact of what is deemed a
professional normative behavior in organizational context. Workers are expected never
to dismiss superiors or rather act subservient to them as a badge of professional loyalty
and commitment. Even the white-collar employees are often indoctrinated to comply
with some of these norms and ideals in the name of professional grooming to make their
way into organizations and subsequently climb up the ladder. In short, the inability to
challenge the status quo and defy organizational control and domination partially stems
from heedless adherence to what constitutes professionally normative or acceptable.

The impact of such influence and control would be felt differently by different employees
depending on a host of contextual factors. Although the shared part of such experience seems
to have been both institutionalized on a so-called professional level and normalized on a personal
level to a great extent. While not always true, work can be dehumanizing and self-deprecating
for employees if they are simply treated as “means” expendable to achieve a desired end.

As Marx puts it, while a part of labor is directed towards furnishing tangible produce
– an object sold and exchanged in markets – it is not only the physical, alien, and power-
independent commodity that the labor generates but also the power-dependent part of itself
that is constantly surrendered and succumbed to the domination of the elite in the process
of bringing the underlying commodity to life. But given the world reeks of capitalism – in
both implicit and explicit ways – is it even possible to preclude the vitiation of labor? Or is
it a fanciful dream realizable only to the extent that benefits the organizational elite? Is this
one of the reasons most workers do not feel committed to their respective jobs? The fact that
over three-fourths of the workplace either did the bare minimum or were actively disengaged
at the job is itself quite alarming and concerning 1. This leads me back to the question – are
organizations meant to subjugate the powerless to preserve and perpetuate the social order?
